# .Net Learning Course 2019/01 Edition

Hi every one!
This github hosts the **.Net Learning Course 2019/01 Edition**. A way or tutorial for learning .Net from zero.
The purpose is to learn then main programming paradigms:
- Procedural Programming
- Object Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming

## How it works
- The main repository project is a basic vehicle management software with business libraries, WinForms and web interfaces.

### Release branches
- Each release branch is a checkpoint or exercise to complete by student.
- **develop** is the ancestor branch of release branches. This branch has compilable solution and project but with skeletical and implementation pending classes. In other words, almost all methods and classes has the same code statement: *throw new NotImplementedException();*

### Unit testing
- The way to know if the studen has implemented correctly the release is running the **unit tests**.

### Student's workspace
- The student must use his or her name as prefix for to create branches from releases branch. For example, *pepe/1.0.0-procedural-programming*.
- Once the studen has completed first release, he or she can merge into his branch the next release branch. The will be what-the-hell **merges** :scream:
